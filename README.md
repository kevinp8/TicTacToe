# TicTacToe
made in python with sockets

Launch player2.py first, then player1.py

After making a move on one board, it will freeze and seem like it is crashing.
That is because it is waiting to receive the other board's move.
Just make a move for the other board and the grid will update with the X's and O's
I have no idea how to fix this :P
